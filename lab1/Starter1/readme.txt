For this assignment we divide up the scanning of leximes into two categories
Geoffrey handled the tokenizing common operators, delimiters, and keywords for the lex file.
Rashad handled the tokenizing the integers, decimals and special functions calls for the lex file.

We split the task of indentifying the type of the token in parser.y.

Both of us contributed to proposing possible corner cases and test cases we could use to check the functionality and correctness of the scanner such as checking for buffer overflow cases and whether input exceed it maximum allowable length.
